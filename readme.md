## Copilot Asked

**What is XYink?**

XYink is me. People online call me Ink. I like code. :)

**What is this website?**

This website serves as a central piece to my GitHub by linking all my projects together in one singular place.

**Who are you?**

Ugh, I am Ink, I code. I like OOP and I don't like Python.

**What is your favorite language?**

Java is #1 in my heart, but I also like C# and C++. Python sucks. F tier.

**What is your favorite IDE?**

VSC ain't my thing, JetBrains just works so much better. I use IntelliJ for Java, Webstorm for Web Dev and for C#, I use VS 2022.

**Kotlin or Java?**

I have not yet tried Kotlin, but I am sure it's a great programming language as it managed to replace Java in most domains.

**Do you have a website?**

This one.

**Who wrote these questions?**

Actually, most of them were written by GitHub Copilot. That is why they suck.

**What is your favorite game?**

Subnautica is my favorite game of all time, no questions asked. Every second of playtime was filled with joy and screams. It is a true masterpiece of game design.

**What is your favorite movie?**    

I'm not a big movie fan myself, but I do like a Lord of The Rings every so often.

**Why am I reading this?**

I don't know, why are you?
